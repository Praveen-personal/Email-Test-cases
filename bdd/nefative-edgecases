Scenario: Attaching a file larger than 25 MB
  Given I have opened Gmail
  When I click "Compose"
  And I attach a file larger than 25 MB
  And I enter a valid recipient, subject, and body
  And I click "Send"
  Then an error message should appear saying "Attachment exceeds the maximum size limit."

Scenario: Sending an email with too many recipients
  Given I have opened Gmail
  When I click "Compose"
  And I add more than the allowed number of recipients (e.g., 500)
  And I enter a subject and body
  And I click "Send"
  Then an error message should appear saying "Too many recipients."

Scenario: Sending an email with duplicate recipients
  Given I have opened Gmail
  When I click "Compose"
  And I add the same recipient multiple times in the "To" field
  And I enter a subject and body
  And I click "Send"
  Then the email should be sent successfully, ignoring duplicate recipients.
